            <div class="Heading-Text">Hello! I am a knitter based in Arlington, VA. I started knitting in 2019 and haven't stopped since. I began with a simple, garter stitch shawl and moved on 
                quickly to intricate lace, cozy scarves, and garments. I'm always looking for ways to push my self and expand my skill set. Feel free to look around Ravelry and a 
                few of my finished items. </div>
